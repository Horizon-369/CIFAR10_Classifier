# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates an image classification model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving an impressive accuracy of 91%. The model has been deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio for easy access and demonstration.

## CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning models for image classification tasks.

## Model
* Architecture: ResNet Architecture Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Accuracy: 91%
* Framework:  PyTorch
* Getting Started
To explore the model, you can visit the deployed Hugging Face Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kshitij-369/CIFAR10_Classifier


## How to Use
